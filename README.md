# Info

Canvas-noice.js, a self-made particle rendering tool using chunks to speed up rendering process, inspired by [hustcc/canvas-nest.js](https://github.com/hustcc/canvas-nest.js).

## Details

Written below are several optimize methods that I use in this project with a grading for each from 1 to 5. (1 means slightly performance improvement while 5 means significant perf. improvement)

- chunks (5)
    - divergence property (3)
    - draw buffer (5)
    - async tasking (?)
    - size optimization (2~3)
- particle laziness (2)
- fps manager (4)
